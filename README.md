# Self Platform Project

## Project idea

This project starts as an idea of a platform for managing many things personal, as for example one's personal portfolio data, CV / resume data like projects, skills, experiences, academic formation, etc, with a dashboard / CMS for editing everything and choosing what to be published on the frontends. The dashbord should be accessible at `/dashboard`.

I devise the possibility of multiple public frontends with different objectives, for example, one portfolio at `/portfolio`, a specific developer resume at `/resume`, etc.
